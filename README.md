# **EarthTemp** üó∫Ô∏è

This is my first-ever project, and it contains code and data for a website that displays temperature anomalies of the earth. The website provides users with an interactive map that allows them to explore temperature anomalies by region and period. The data used in the website are sourced from reputable organizations that collect and analyze temperature data such as NASA and NOAA.

The code in this repository is written only in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and uses various libraries for data visualization. It is designed to be responsive and accessible on different devices and screen sizes.

### Still work in progress
